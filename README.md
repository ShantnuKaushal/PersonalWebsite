# Profile Page

This repository contains the source code for a single-page personal profile website built with React, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It serves as a living, interactive résumé and portfolio that introduces me, showcases my skills and experience, and gives visitors multiple ways to connect with me.

## Features

The site embraces a modern, glassmorphism aesthetic with semi-transparent cards and subtle drop shadows. Page sections snap neatly into the viewport, ensuring that only one major section occupies the center of the screen at a time. All buttons and icons animate smoothly on hover or focus. Responsive breakpoints ensure the layout adjusts gracefully across desktops, tablets, and phones. 

## Technologies Used

This project is built with:
- **React** for component-based architecture and smooth state-driven animations  
- **HTML5** and **CSS3** (including CSS variables and keyframe animations)  
- **JavaScript** for carousel logic and scroll-spy behavior
